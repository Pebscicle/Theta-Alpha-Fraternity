    <p data-aos="fade-in-out" data-aos-duration="750">We are Theta Alpha, a grassroots Fraternity which currently operates at the University of Stirling.
    Founded in 2017, our organisation is currently the sole existing University Fraternity in Scotland,
    and since its inception has consistently striven to provide a unique and fulfilling experience for each
    of our Brothers. There are three values which we wish to instil in our membership - Honour,
    Brotherhood & Scholarship - each of these values holds a core place in the work that we do, and in
    the direction that we want to take our organisation.</p>

    <p data-aos="fade-in-out" data-aos-duration="750">Aside from providing a space for our Brothers to congregate through our Chapter meetings, our
    Fraternity has also consistently sought to undertake tasks to the benefit of ourselves and the
    community around us. This has taken the form of charity fundraising events, drives for relief
    efforts and work with the homeless across Stirling, Edinburgh and Glasgow. These efforts are an
    example of the wider action that the community we have fostered is able to undertake, and has
    enabled our membership to gain hands-on experience in attempts to positively impact the lives of
    others.</p>

    <p data-aos="fade-in-out" data-aos-duration="750">Aside from our charity efforts, the Fraternity also seeks to provide unique leisurely opportunities
    unlike many found in traditional university societies. We have historically provided our members
    with the chance to host and curate underground events, take part in debate nights and public
    speaking alongside a plethora of other activities that come with being an active member of Theta
    Alpha. Our main Brother-oriented event is an annual Winter retreat taking place deep into the
    Scottish Highlands, which gives our Brothers an enlivening end of semester experience</p>
